# Currently, we're requiring at least Node v18.20, which introduced import
# attributes (`with` keyword) and removed import asserts (`assert` keyword).
#
# We can't support Node v23+, until `argon2-browser` receives an update that
# supports Node's native `fetch`, i.e., which doesn't require the now obsolete
# `--no-experimental-fetch` flag.
#
# So, let's default to v22.
